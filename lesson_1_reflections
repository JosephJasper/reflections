How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made it pretty easy.  This of course that only helps if the typo was not originally present.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It makes you more mindful of how your changes are implemented, but it also makes it easier to see how you solved for a problem previously.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You may make multiple complicated changes in a commit and not be able to easily find where something went wrong.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    With Git, the multiple files in a "version" may make more sense as a power user functionality where one file may reference another.  Google docs' way of treating each file separately is easier for basic users to understand and utilize.
